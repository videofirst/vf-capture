# VFT-Capture UI

Simple user interface, programmed in React but will run in an embedded web container packaged using Spring boot (from `/api`).


## Development

- Ensure [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is installed.
- Change directory to `ui` folder and start yarn

```bash
cd ui
yarn start
```

The user interface is now available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes to the code will
be hot loaded automatically to the browser.


**NOTE:**

- Folder structure is best on [React Folder Structure](https://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html)
- Using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) + theming to compontise react components / simplify CSS.
